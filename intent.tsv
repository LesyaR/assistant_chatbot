Hello. Why does the model decide it was generated using GAN? I am pretty sure this is a real photo. It was taken by Guardian on October 2024.	1	0	0	1	1	0	en
It is hard to interpret the output. How can I see the specific regions that the model takes into account when it says the image is synthetic?	0	0	1	0	1	0	en
I would like to be able to save the output with the prediction so that I can include it into external reports.	0	0	1	0	0	1	en

Hi. I keep getting at error that the server could not return the result. I am pretty sure this same URL worked yesterday. And there is no explanation interface would provide apart from the rror message.	1	1	0	0	0	0	en
